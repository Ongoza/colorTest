goods you purchase and the responsibility to insure the goods passes

the Order Acceptance.

been personalized or modified in accordance with your instructions.
The goods must be fully returned in the original packaging with the
applicable proof of purchase and you will be responsible for the cost

information are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.

and revise your order accordingly (which includes charging the

</p>
<h4 class="western">18. Dispute Resolution 
</h4>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES
YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (JURY TRIAL WAIVER) OF ANY AND
ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND
SMALL CLAIMS) WITH Company AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN
SEEK RELIEF FROM Company (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR
REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS). 
</p>
<p>18.1 <u>Binding Arbitration; Disputes; Small Claims</u>. <b>You
and Company agree to waive any right to a jury trial, or the right to
have any Dispute resolved in any court, and instead accept the use of
binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or
more impartial persons for a final and binding determination);
provided, however, that you have the right to litigate any Dispute in
small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims
court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at
issue in the Dispute, are satisfied. You agree to bring a Dispute in
small claims court in San Mateo County, California or, if you reside
in the U.S., in a small claims court in your county of residence</b>.
“<b>Dispute</b>” as used in this Section 18 means any dispute,
cause of action, claim, or controversy arising out of or in any way
related to Company, these Terms, the subject matter of these Terms,
or access to and use of the Services, including but not limited to
contract, personal injury, tort, warranty, statute or regulation, or
other legal or equitable basis and disputes that involve third
parties (such as developers of Third Party Content), except any
dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy relating to Company’s
intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,
trade secrets, copyrights, and/or patents). You and Company empower
the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of
these terms or formation of this contract, including the
arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of
these terms are void or voidable. 
</p>
<p>18.2 <u>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative
Actions</u>. <b>You and Company agree that any Dispute is personal to
you and Company, and that any Dispute shall only be resolved by an
individual arbitration and shall not be brought as a class
arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.
Neither party agrees to class arbitration, or an arbitration where a
person brings a Dispute as a representative of any other person or
persons. Neither you nor Company agree that a Dispute can be brought
as a class or representative action whether inside or outside of
arbitration, or on behalf of any other person or persons</b>. 
</p>
<p>18.3 <u>Federal Arbitration Act</u>. You and Company agree that
these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of
Section 18 shall be governed by, construed, and enforced, both
substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“<b>FAA</b>”) to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law. 
</p>
<p>18.4 <u>Confidentiality</u>. The arbitrator, Company, and you
shall maintain the confidentiality of any proceedings, including but
not limited to, any and all information gathered, prepared, and
presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the
Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator shall have the authority to make
appropriate rulings to safeguard that confidentiality, unless the law
provides to the contrary. 
</p>
<p>18.5 <u>Process</u>. Our goal is to resolve claims fairly and
quickly. Accordingly, for any Dispute that you have against Company,
you agree to first contact Company and attempt to resolve the claim
informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“<b>Notice</b>”)
to Company. The Notice to Company must be sent by certified email
support@sylvernet.net. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence
address, and the email address and/or mobile telephone number
associated with your account; (b) describe the nature and basis of
the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and
Company cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days
after such Notice is received, then either party may, as appropriate
in accordance with this Section 18, commence an arbitration
proceeding or file a claim in court. You and Company agree that any
Dispute must be commenced or filed within one year after such claim
arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred. 
</p>
<p>In the event that you and Company cannot resolve a Dispute and you
do not pursue your claims through small claims court, you or Company
shall promptly submit the Dispute to binding arbitration at the
office of the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”). In
the event AAA declines or is unable to administer the arbitration,
you and Company agree to use an arbitration forum or arbitrator that
you and Company mutually agree upon. If, after making a reasonable
effort, you and Company are not able to agree upon an arbitration
forum or arbitrator, AAA or a court having proper jurisdiction will
appoint an arbitration forum or arbitrator. The arbitration will be
conducted in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“<b>AAA
Rules</b>”) then in effect. The AAA Rules and other information
about AAA and arbitration are readily available at
<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org</a>,
by calling 1-800-778-7879, or by mail at 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New
York, NY 10271. By entering into these Terms, you either (1)
acknowledge that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or (2)
waive reading the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules
are unfair in any way. You and Company agree that these Terms govern
the arbitration, and that the applicable AAA Rules shall be subject
to changes in procedures that AAA may make from time to time. 
</p>
<p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the applicable AAA Rules,
the arbitrator will have the exclusive power and jurisdiction to make
all procedural and substantive decisions concerning the Dispute;
provided, however, that this power does not include the power to
conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is
prohibited by these Terms (as stated above). The arbitrator may only
conduct an individual arbitration, and may not consolidate more than
one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of
representative or class proceeding, or any proceeding on behalf of or
involving more than one person or persons. 
</p>
<p>Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or
brought for an improper purpose, Company will pay all filing, AAA,
and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If the arbitrator issues you an
award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement
offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a
settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then we will pay
you the amount of the award or US $5,000, whichever is greater, and
pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys’ fees incurred,
and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs)
that you or your attorney reasonably accrue for investigating,
preparing and pursuing your claim in arbitration. We waive any right
to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with
any non-frivolous arbitration between you and us. 
</p>
<p>18.6 <u>Right to Opt Out</u>. You may opt out of this agreement to
arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Company can require the
other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you
must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first
became subject to this arbitration provision, and must include your
name and residence address, the email address you use for your
Company account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you
want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. Any requests to opt
out must be sent to support@sylvernet.net. 
</p>
<p>Unless you choose to opt out, this dispute resolution provision in
Section 18 shall survive termination of these Terms. 
</p>
